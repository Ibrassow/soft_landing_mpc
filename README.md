# Planetary Soft Landing 
(Convex) Model Predictive Control for the Soft Landing Problem

This project reproduce the Powered-Descent Guidance algorithm used to solve the classical soft landing problem and run them using a  Model Predictive Controller while we introduce control disturbances. There is still a lot of work to be done before we have robust Powered Descent Guidance algorithms, which means there are many areas for improvement!
